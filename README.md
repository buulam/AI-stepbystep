# Welcome to AI Step-by-Step
Getting started with AI is simple and can be free. The following lab guides act as a starting point for people who want to build their own environment rather than jumping straight into a chat prompt. There will be lab options that are free, then up to ~$1000, then up to a few thousand dollars.

These are Community contributed labs. If you see any opportunities for improvement or errors, please contribute with a Pull Request or notify the Lab Author.
